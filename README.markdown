YEGRB Resque Introduction
=========================

A talk I'm giving to YEGRB on using Resque to manage background notifications for a project I'm working on.  Resque is a Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on queues, and processing them later.

The demo code used in this talk is taken from the Resque source code.  Download the latest version from:
