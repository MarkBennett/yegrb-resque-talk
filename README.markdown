YEGRB Resque Introduction
=========================

This is a talk given to [YEGRB](http://yegrb.com), the Edmonton Ruby Group, on using Resque to manage background notifications for a project I'm working on.  Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on queues, and processing them later.

The demo code used in this talk is taken from [the Resque repo](http://github.com/defunkt/resque/tree/master/examples/demo/).  I encourage you to clone the Resque repo and explore the rest of the examples yourself.
